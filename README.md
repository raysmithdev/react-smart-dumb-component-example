#React Smart/Dumb component concept

A simple demonstration of the "smart" & "dumb" component concept in React. Inspired by https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c. Demonstrates a simple todolist which seperates a component into 2: 1.Smart Component (Business Logic): 'TodoListContainer' component and the 2.Dumb Component (Presentational): 'TodoList' component. Why? It makes our codebase more declarative and easier to seperate the business logic from the presentation of our component.
